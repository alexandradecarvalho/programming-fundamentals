## Lab 07 eXtra



In this extra lab, we will answer the questions in **[practicalguide.md](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab07x/practicalguide.md)** file, which is the practical exercises guide for this complementary lab, provided by one of the Curricular Unit's Professors. For exercise 1, it was needed the already provided **[genFibonacci.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab07x/genFibonacci.py)** file. For exercises 2 and 3, it was needed the already provided **[checkDoubles.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab07x/checkDoubles.py)**. For exercise 4 it was needed the already provided **[findWords.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab07x/findWords.py)** file and for exercise 5 it was needed the already provided [**imctable.py**](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab07x/imctable.py). The practicalguide exercises' resolution is in **[lab07x.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab07x/lab07x.py)** file.
