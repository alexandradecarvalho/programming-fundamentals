## Programming Fundamentals, Class 01

### Introduction to Python



#### Topics

● Introduction to Python.
● Interative and script modes.
● Editing and executing of Python programs.

#### Exercises

1. In interative mode, Python's interpreter can be used as a calculator. In a command line window, execute **python3** command to enter Python's interative mode. Write an expression which calculates how many seconds a full day has.

  

2. Using Python's interative mode (**python3**), execute the following instructions:

```python
num = 17
type(num)
volume = 10.0
type(volume)
word = 'bang'
type(word)
```

Now, determine the value and data type (int, float, str, ...) of each of the following expressions. Use the function **type** to find out a value's type.

```python
1 + 2 * 5
num / 3.0
num / 3
num // 3
num % 3.0
volume / 0.75
volume // 0.75
word + 'rus'
word + 2
word * 2


```



3. While running 10 miles in 43 minutes and 30 seconds, which is the average time by km? Which is the average velocity in km/h? (1 mile = 1,61 km.)

   

4. Compute your application grade to Universidade de Aveiro. Use variables to represent high school grades and appliance test scores. Do it in interative mode.

   

5. Copy the Python instructions used in the previous exercise to a file, in order to create a script which can be executed by the Python interpreter. Notice that in script mode the results have to be explicitly printed.

   

6. Change the previous program to ask the user for the high school grades and appliance test scores (using the **input** function). Run the program a few times, with different data each time. Notice that the **input** function returns a string value, which needs to be converted to the desired type!

   

7. Execute the **welcome.py** program and see what happens. Change the program so that the X is replaced by the value asked to the user.

   

8. The **plot.py** program makes charts from two functions. Try executing it. You must close the window to end it. Edit the program to understand it. You can print variable values or change some parameters to see what happens. This program uses two extra modules that extend the language with new functions which allow vector operations and chart drawings. We'll use them again later.

  

9. Change the previous program to generate a third graphic with the result of the multiplication of functions y1 and y2. Make the graph with lines and green balls.
