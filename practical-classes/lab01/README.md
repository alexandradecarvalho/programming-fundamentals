## Lab 01.



In this lab, we will start by exploring some Linux functionalities, with the **[intro-to-linux.md](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab01/intro-to-linux.md)** guide, which is an adaptation of the one provided by the Curricular Unit's Professors. For some of the exercises, it was needed the already provided **primeiro.py** file. The record of intro-to-linux exercises is written in **intro-to-linux-answers.md** file.



Secondly, this lab provides the **[practicalguide.md](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab01/practicalguide.md)** file, which is the actual practical exercises guide for the lab, provided by one of the Curricular Unit's Professors. For some of the exercises, it was needed the already provided **welcome.py** and the **plot.py** files. The practicalguide exercises' resolution is in **lab01.py** file.
