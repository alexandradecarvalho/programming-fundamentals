## Lab 08.



In this lab, we will answer the questions in **[practicalguide.md](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab08/practicalguide.md)** file, which is the actual practical exercises guide for the lab, provided by one of the Curricular Unit's Professors. Exercise 1 was resolved in the **[ex01-answers.md](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab08/ex01-answers.md)** file, while the other resolutions can be found in the **[lab08.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab08/lab08.py)** file.



For exercise 2, the **[pg3333.txt](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab08/pg3333.txt)** file was downloaded from the Gutenberg Program and then used.
