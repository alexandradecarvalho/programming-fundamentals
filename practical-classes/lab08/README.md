## Lab 08.



In this lab, we will answer the questions in **[practicalguide.md](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab08/practicalguide.md)** file, which is the actual practical exercises guide for the lab, provided by one of the Curricular Unit's Professors. Exercise 1 was tested with **[nums.txt](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab07/nums.txt)** file, just like exercise 6, with addition of **[nums2.txt](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab07/nums2.txt)** file. For exercise 2, it was needed the already provided **[turtledraw.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab07/turtledraw.py)** and the provided **[mystery.txt](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab07/mystery.txt)** file, and for exercise 3 it was needed the already provided [**school.py**](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab07/school.py) and the provided **[school.csv](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab07/school.scv)**. The practicalguide exercises' resolution is in **[lab07.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab07/lab07.py)** file. The file **[ex4result.txt](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab07/ex4result.txt)** is the output of ex4.
