## Lab 10.



In this lab, we will answer the questions in **[practicalguide.md](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab10/practicalguide.md)** file, which is the actual practical exercises guide for the lab, provided by one of the Curricular Unit's Professors. Exercise 1 was resolved in the **[ex01-answers.md](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab10/ex01-answers.md)** file, while the other resolutions can be found in the **[lab10.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab10/lab10.py)** file.



For exercise 3, it was needed the already provided **[imctable2.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab09/imctable2.py)** file. For exercise 7, it was needed the already provided **[insertionSort.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab10/insertionSort.py)** file, and for exercise 8 it was needed the already provided **[polynomial.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab10/polynomial.py)**.
