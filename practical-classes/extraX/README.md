## Extra X.



In this lab, we will answer the questions in **[practicalguide.md](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/extrax/practicalguide.md)** file, which is the actual practical exercises guide for the lab, provided by one of the Curricular Unit's Professors. The exercises' resolutions can be found in the **[extrax.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/extrax/extrax.py)** file.

For exercise 1, we used the already provided **[chamadas1.txt](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/extrax/chamadas1.txt)** and **[chamadas2.txt](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/extrax/chamadas2.txt)** files.
