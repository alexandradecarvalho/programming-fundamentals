In this lab, we will answer the questions in **[practicalguide.md](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab06/practicalguide.md)** file, which is the actual practical exercises guide for the lab, provided by one of the Curricular Unit's Professors. For exercise 2, it was needed the already provided **[table.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab06/table.py)**, for exercise 3 it was needed the already provided [**turtle.py**](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab05/turtle.py). For exercise 4 it was needed the already provided [**sequenceUn.py**](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab06/sequenceUn.py) and for exercise 6 it was needed the already provided **[hilo.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab06/hilo.py)** file.
