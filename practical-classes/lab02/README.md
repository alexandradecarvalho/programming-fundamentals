## Lab 02.



In this lab, we will answer the questions in **[practicalguide.md](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab02/practicalguide.md)** file, which is the practical exercises guide for the lab, provided by one of the Curricular Unit's Professors. For some of the exercises, it was needed the already provided **[points.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab02/points.py)** file. The practicalguide exercises' resolution is in **[lab02.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab02/lab02.py)** file.
