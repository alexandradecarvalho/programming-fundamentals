## Lab 03.



In this lab, we will answer the questions in **[practicalguide.md](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab04/practicalguide.md)** file, which is the actual practical exercises guide for the lab, provided by one of the Curricular Unit's Professors. For exercise 1, it was needed the already provided **[bmi.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab04/bmi.py)** and for exercise 7 it was needed the already provided **[dates.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab04/dates.py)** file. The practicalguide exercises' resolution is in **[lab03.py](https://github.com/alexandradecarvalho/programming-fundamentals/blob/main/practical-classes/lab04/lab04.py)** file.
